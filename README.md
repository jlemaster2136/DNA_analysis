# DNA Alignment Tool
Obtain alignment location and percent similarity of two local DNA sequences.

## Prerequisites
```
Python 3
```
## Introduction

Simply enter two sequences into the following function: 
```
dna_alignment(strand_a, strand_b)
```
The function will align the shorter of the two sequences onto the longer one. 

For Example, the function will output the similarity and alignment location of the shorter strand in relation to the longer strand. 

**NOTE:** This is one of my first projects done in python and is not meant to be a sophisticated bioinformatics tool.
